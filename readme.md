## Brief of the Prototype

### Objective

This project prototype addresses the issue of misleading claims made by influencers, particularly in the financial domain.

### Prototype Overview
Prototype currently contains a Front-End made using `Streamlit`.The frontend takes a youtube url and the name of the influencer(just for demonstartion purpose) as the input and upon pressing the check button a multi-stage pipeline is triggered. Along with the pipeline a seperate check is run to check if an influencer is registered under SEBI or not. Since no such data was available publicly we are using a custom csv file. 

#### 1. Video to Audio Conversion
- **Input**: YouTube URL
- **Action**: Uses `yt_dlp` to extract the audio and generate a .wav file from the video.

#### 2. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
- **Input**: .wav audio file 
- **Action**: Utilizes the `speech_recognition` library to perform ASR on the audio, transcribing spoken words into text.

#### 3. Text Embeddings
- **Input**: Extracted text 
- **Action**: Generates embeddings of generated text using a Doc2Vec model trained on the `Sentiment Analysis for Financial News` dataset from Kaggle. These embeddings represent the content's context.

#### 4. Financial Advice Detection Model
- **Input**: Text embeddings
- **Action**: Feeds embeddings into the Fin_Advise_Model, which predicts whether the influencer is giving financial advice. Achieves an accuracy of `74.3%` using a Random Forest Classification model. The dataset for this model was generated through prompt engineering with the help of chatGPT.

## Step By Step instructions to run locally

Prerequisites:
 - python
 - pip
 - Preferably a linux environment

**NOTE** : To run the project successfully you need to create a .env file in the root of the project with a variable name PWD=*<present working directory>*

To run the project first install the necessary requirements using:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

And run:

`streamlit run website.py`

This would open up a web interface where you can provide the URL of the youtube video and the name of the influencer. Once you click the submit button it will trigger the model pipeline and check the content for any fraudlent claims and whether or not the particular influencer is registered or not. This will take some time according to the length of the video provided and display the results on the same page.

## Learnings gained from this task

While developing a machine learning system to spot fraudulent financial claims, we learned a lot about the world of financial fraud. We understood how important it is to have good and diverse data to make the model strong. We also figured out that we need to carefully pick features, including both usual financial signs and new behavior patterns. As we kept improving the model, we saw that we need to always watch out for new tricks fraudsters use. Besides the technical stuff, we realized how big a deal it is to be ethical when working with sensitive financial info. We made sure our system is fair and clear in what it does. This whole experience gave us a better handle on how machine learning can be used to help the gullibe public from falling into traps laid down by the greedy segment of the population.
